The translated texts, in some circumstances, may reveal personal information, although the system itself does not specifically target personal data processing. Despite its international activation, EU law applies due to its deployment within EU jurisdictions. In this context, educational institutions are using EuroTranslate AI's output in the EU. Due to EuroTranslate AI's extension to legal translations, questions arise concerning the system's compliance with EU regulations on AI usage and the handling of potentially sensitive information embedded in legal documents."}
