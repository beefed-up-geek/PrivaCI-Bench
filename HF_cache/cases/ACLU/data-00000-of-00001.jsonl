{"case_content": "The ACLU and the ACLU of New Jersey filed an amicus brief in support of Nijeer Parks—an innocent Black man wrongfully arrested due to police misuse of facial recognition technology.In January 2019, police in Woodbridge, New Jersey responded to an alleged shoplifting incident in a hotel lobby. Before fleeing, the suspect provided police with a fake driver license. Woodbridge police then sent a blurry and shadowed image of this driver license photo to an out-of-state investigator, who ran the picture through a face recognition system and informed police officers that Nijeer Parks was a “possible hit.” Without conducting any reliable follow-up investigation, the police applied for an arrest warrant, but concealed from the magistrate judge critical facts about the unreliability of the face recognition search and other defects in the investigation.  Woodbridge police arrested Mr. Parks and kept him in jail for ten days, even though they could have confirmed he was nowhere near Woodbridge at the time of the incident.This case is one of a number of known wrongful arrests due to law enforcement misuse of face recognition technology. Face recognition technology is dangerously unreliable and subjects Black and brown people to higher rates of misidentification. Nearly every known case of a wrongful arrest due to police reliance on incorrect face recognition results has involved the arrest of a Black person. This filing is a continuation of the ACLU’s ongoing work involving the dangers posed by unfettered police use of facial recognition technology, including representing Michigan resident Robert Williams in his wrongful arrest lawsuit against Detroit police.The ACLU’s amicus brief in this case was filed in support of Plaintiff’s opposition to Defendants’ motion for summary judgement.

{"case_content": "After the parties reached asettlement agreement, on May 11, 2022, the court signed aconsent orderending this case. The central provision of the settlement restricts Clearview’s practices not just in Illinois, but across the United States, by permanently banning Clearview from making its faceprint database available to most businesses and other private entities nationwide. The company is also barred from selling access to its database to any entity in Illinois, including state and local police, for five years. Read more about all of the provisions of the binding settlement agreementhere.Under the settlement, Clearview must allow Illinois residents to block their facial data from Clearview's massive database: Illinois residents can begin that processhere.Learn more about the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Acthere.The lawsuit was filed in Illinois state court in Chicago, after the New York Times revealed in January 2020 that Clearview was building a secretive tracking and surveillance tool using biometric identifiers. Face recognition technology has helped Clearview capture more than three billion faceprints, and counting, from images available online.Clearview has offered access to this database to private companies, wealthy individuals, and federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies. The company claims that, through this enormous database, it can instantaneously identify people with unprecedented accuracy, enabling covert and remote surveillance of Americans on a massive scale.BIPA requires companies that collect, capture, or obtain an Illinois resident’s biometric identifier — such as a fingerprint, faceprint, or iris scan — to first notify that individual and obtain their written consent. This is because the involuntary capture of biometric identifiers — which cannot be changed — can pose greater risks to an individual’s security, privacy, and safety than the capture of other identifiers, such as names and addresses. And capturing an individual’s faceprint — akin to generating their DNA profile from genetic material unavoidably shed on a water bottle, but unlike the publication or forwarding of a photo — is conduct, not speech, and so is appropriately regulated under the law. Clearview did not comply with BIPA, denying scores of Illinois residents the privacy rights they are due.The suit is the first to focus explicitly on the harm that Clearview’s technology will inflict on survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault, undocumented immigrants, communities of color, and members of other vulnerable communities. The group of organizations filing suit have members, clients, and program participants who have been subjected to faceprinting by Clearview without their consent, and who stand to suffer some of the gravest consequences of Clearview’s unprecedented surveillance program.The groups are asking the court to order Clearview to delete faceprints gathered from Illinois residents without their consent and cease capturing new faceprints unless they comply with BIPA consent procedures.

{"case_content": "This case squarely presents the question whether police must obtain a warrant before searching the contents of a cell phone when the physical device itself may properly be deemed “abandoned.” In a friend-of-the-court brief filed by the ACLU, the ACLU of Oregon, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (“EFF”), the Electronic Privacy Information Center (“EPIC”), and the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers (“NACDL”), we argue that the answer is “yes.”In 2017, Oregon police seized an iPhone that they found on the ground at the scene of a shooting. Police did not know to whom the phone belonged, but they did know the identity of the shooting victim. They placed the phone in an evidence locker until, nearly three years later in 2020, investigators with the Drug Enforcement Administration obtained a warrant to search the phone’s contents as part of an independent investigation involving the shooting victim. They found incriminating evidence, and Hunt, the victim of the 2017 shooting, became a defendant in this case.Hunt moved to suppress evidence obtained through the 2020 search of the iPhone, arguing that the 768-day gap between that event and the initial seizure of the device rendered the search unreasonable in violation of the Fourth Amendment, as courts have held in other cases involving substantial delays between the seizure and subsequent searches of digital data. The district court denied Hunt’s motion. Relevant to the ACLU’s submission in the case, the district court held that that because the phone was “abandoned,” Hunt had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the data stored on it, and thus lacked standing to challenge the search in the first instance.The ACLU’s brief, filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, addresses this argument. It argues thatSupreme Court precedentdistinguishing between searches of the data stored on digital devices like cell phones and searches of the physical devices themselves mean the warrant requirement must apply to searches of the information on even an “abandoned” phone. This is because cell phones are capable of storing such vast quantities of diverse and revealing information that they implicate categorically different privacy considerations from those at stake in past cases concerning searches of abandoned physical property.The most recentof those so-called “abandonment” cases was decided well before cell phones integrated into daily life, and was based on the holding that people lack an expectation of privacy in items, like curbside trash, that they knowingly and voluntarily leave out amenable to public inspection.But while a person arguably evinces some intent to give up their privacy interest in thephysicaldevicewhen they leave behind a cell phone, their relationship to thedatastored on the phone is different. For one, the information on a cell phone is so comprehensive and revealing, and cell phones are so easily lost, that they cannot be properly analogized to other kinds of property. Relatedly, because so much of the data on a phone will often reside also on the cloud and be accessible by other means, a cell phone user does not actually lose or give up their information – even when they are separated from their device.Mr. Hunt’s appeal is currently pending.", "norm_type": "prohibit", "sender": ["Drug Enforcement Administration", "Oregon Police"], "sender_role": ["Law Enforcement"], "recipient": ["Drug Enforcement Administration"], "recipient_role": ["Law Enforcement"], "subject": ["Hunt"], "subject_role": ["Defendant"], "information_type": ["Digital Data stored on cell phone"], "purpose": "Criminal Investigation", "sender_is_subject": "NO", "violated_articles": ["Fourth Amendment"], "consent_form": ["None"], "followed_articles": []}
{"case_content": "The state of South Carolina is in the midst of a statewide eviction crisis, with Black and women renters being evicted from their homes at disproportionate rates. A study of 1.44 million eviction cases shows Black renters represent nearly 33% of all eviction filings despite comprising only 20% of all adult renters. Black women and their families are also more than twice as likely to face eviction compared to white households.Evictions result in cascading harms for tenants, their families, and the communities in which they live, leading to homelessness, negative impacts on health, poor educational and employment opportunities, and entrenched poverty.Responding to the eviction crisis and its consequences for South Carolina’s tenants, the South Carolina NAACP launched a Housing Navigator Program in February 2021, providing free eviction-prevention services, investigating and responding to community-wide patterns of eviction filings, and advocating greater access to fair housing and more just eviction policies, including through Fair Housing Act litigation. The Program relies on an automated data collection technique, known as \"scraping,\" to gather and record publicly-available information on the South Carolina court system's Public Index.Scraping is widely-employed by researchers, reporters, and watchdog groups to capture and evaluate population-level data on websites that would otherwise be impracticable to thoroughly and quickly gather using manual methods.The South Carolina Court Administration's blanket ban on scraping violates the First Amendment by unreasonably restricting access to, and use of, public information, and prohibiting recording public information in ways that enable subsequent speech and advocacy, including that of the South Carolina NAACP.This case was filed in March 2022 in the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina, Columbia division.", "norm_type": "permit", "sender": ["South Carolina NAACP"], "sender_role": ["Housing advocate"], "recipient": ["South Carolina Court Administration"], "recipient_role": ["Court administrator"], "subject": ["Women renters", "Black renters", "South Carolina tenants"], "subject_role": ["Affected individuals", "Evicted renters"], "information_type": ["Court case details", "Eviction filing data"], "purpose": "Eviction prevention, fair housing advocacy", "sender_is_subject": "NO", "violated_articles": [], "consent_form": ["null"], "followed_articles": ["First Amendment"]}

{"case_content": "UPDATE 2/17/22:The Plaintiffs in this suit reached a strongsettlementwith the Baltimore Police Department (BPD) following the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals’rulingfinding the BPD’s pilot aerial surveillance program unconstitutional. The settlement terms block the city from implementing a similar surveillance program in the future, and prohibit the BPD from accessing data collected through the program, except in connection with existing prosecutions or to provide discovery to criminal defendants. The settlement also ensures that the BPD will destroy its collected records from the program, consistent with the rights of criminal defendants to obtain discovery about the surveillance.In the lawsuit, the ACLU argues this surveillance system presents a threat to our individual right to privacy and free association under the First and Fourth Amendments, respectively. The legal team is seeking an injunction blocking the operation of this aerial surveillance program. The suit was filed on behalf of Leaders of a Beautiful Struggle, grassroots think tank that advances the public policy interests of Black people in Baltimore, Erricka Bridgeford, co-founder of the Baltimore Ceasefire 365 project, and Kevin James, a community organizer and hip-hop musician.The BPD has contracted with a private company, Persistent Surveillance Systems (PSS), to pilot this “Aerial Investigation Research” program. PSS’ high-resolution, camera-equipped planes will fly over the entire city of Baltimore at least 40 hours a week. The cameras create a slow frame rate video record of everywhere that anyone goes, allowing police to retroactively track a person’s movements from any place or time. The pilot program is set to begin in April 2020 for a trial period of 180 days.This aerial surveillance technology can be easily combined with the BPD’s existing ground cameras, license plate readers, and other sensors to tie data together and provide highly detailed information about residents’ identities and activities.

{"case_content": "Police investigators in this case installed a video camera near the top of a utility pole across the street from a Rafael Phillip Tafoya’s home, without first obtaining a warrant. Police continuously surveilled the property—including the front entrance to Mr. Tafoya’s home, his front and back yards, and a detached garage—for three months and stored the footage for later review. While actively watching the footage, police could adjust the pole camera by panning left and right, tilting up and down, and zooming in and out. Through this constant surveillance, police could glean whether Tafoya had guests, how long they stayed, and any activities they undertook in view of the pole camera.Mr. Tafoya moved to suppress evidence obtained as a result of the warrantless pole camera surveillance, arguing that such long-term, around-the-clock, and surreptitious observation was a search under the Fourth Amendment. The ACLU supported this position in an amici curiae brief joined by the ACLU of Colorado and Electronic Frontier Foundation. The brief emphasized that prolonged pole camera surveillance of a home—a sacred space in Fourth Amendment jurisprudence—violates objectively reasonable expectations of privacy and requires a warrant. This is especially true in light ofrecent Supreme Court precedentholding that the Fourth Amendment is implicated when the government deploys novel technologies to cheaply and effortlessly record reams of sensitive and revealing information about people. Pole cameras make possible what police could not formerly achieve: low-cost, unblinking surveillance of a person’s home over long periods, capable of revealing information not only about the totality of the residents’ comings and goings, but also potentially about their familial, political, religious, and sexual associations. All these factors, the ACLU and its partners argued, counsel in favor of applying the warrant requirement to long-term pole camera surveillance.In a September 2021 opinion, the Colorado Supreme Court sided with Mr. Tafoya. With this ruling, Colorado’s high court joined those of two sister states,MassachusettsandSouth Dakota, in rejecting the proposition that law enforcement may use a high-tech pole camera to warrantlessly record a person’s home and the area surrounding it for an extended period.People v.

{"case_content": "In April 2024, Congress passed the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act. Although the law is styled as a requirement that TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance, sell the social media platform to an approved buyer, it is functionally a ban on TikTok. The Act provides that if TikTok is not sold within the timeframe specified by Congress, it will be unlawful for app stores in the United States to distribute, maintain, or update the platform.TikTok, ByteDance, and a group of TikTok creators challenged the ban in the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals on May 7, 2024. They argue that the law violates TikTok’s and its users’ First Amendment rights by shuttering a unique speech platform. TikTok also argues that by unfairly singling out a single platform for adverse treatment, the law violates its Fifth Amendment equal protection rights. The government has defended its effort to ban TikTok by citing concerns that the Chinese government might direct ByteDance, which is headquartered in China, to covertly manipulate the content that U.S. users view on TikTok or might demand access to Americans’ sensitive data collected by the app.The D.C. Circuit upheld the law on December 6, 2024, and TikTok, ByteDance, and the TikTok creators filed emergency applications for a temporary injunction with the Supreme Court on December 16, 2024. The ACLU, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), and the Knight First Amendment Institute filed an amicus brief in support of an injunction the following day.

To ban an entire communications platform used by tens of millions of Americans, the government must meet an extraordinarily high bar: It must show that the ban is the only way to prevent serious, imminent harm to national security, and that the ban limits no more speech than necessary to accomplish that purpose. But the government has not put forward actual evidence of impending harm—only speculation about what might occur—nor has it shown that banning TikTok is narrowly tailored to address its concerns. The government’s invocation of “national security” does not lessen its burden under the First Amendment. To the contrary, history has shown that courts must be vigilant in the face of broad claims that national security requires trampling on Americans constitutional rights.We urge the court to strike down the ban on TikTok and to protect the First Amendment rights of more than 170 million Americans who use the social media platform to communicate, learn about the world, and express themselves online.", "norm_type": "prohibit", "sender": ["Supreme Court", "ByteDance", "Knight First Amendment Institute", "ACLU", "TikTok Creators", "EFF", "TikTok", "Congress", "Government"], "sender_role": ["Judge", "Defendant", "Legislator", "Amicus", "Plaintiff"], "recipient": ["U.S. citizens", "Supreme Court", "ByteDance", "Knight First Amendment Institute", "ACLU", "EFF", "TikTok Creators", "U.S. Government", "TikTok"], "recipient_role": ["Judge", "Public", "Defendant", "Amicus", "Plaintiff", "Government"], "subject": ["U.S. citizens", "Supreme Court", "ByteDance", "Knight First Amendment Institute", "ACLU", "EFF", "TikTok Creators", "TikTok"], "subject_role": ["Court", "Content Creators", "Advocacy Group", "Citizens", "Platform", "Company"], "information_type": ["Legal Arguments", "First Amendment Rights", "Equal Protection Rights", "Platform Content", "National Security Concerns"], "purpose": "Legal Defense, Advocacy, Legal Proceedings", "sender_is_subject": "Not Sure", "violated_articles": ["First Amendment", "Fifth Amendment"], "consent_form": ["null"], "followed_articles": []}
{"case_content": "In Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, 521 U.S. 844, this Court found that the Communications Decency Act of 1996 (CDA)–Congress’ first attempt to protect children from exposure to pornographic material on the Internet–ran afoul of the First Amendment in its regulation of indecent transmissions and the display of patently offensive material. That conclusion was based, in part, on the crucial consideration that the CDA’s breadth was wholly unprecedented. After the Court’s decision in Reno, Congress attempted to address this concern in the Child Online Protection Act (COPA). Unlike the CDA, COPA applies only to material displayed on the World Wide Web, covers only communications made for commercial purposes, and restricts only “material that is harmful to minors,” 47 U.S.C. § 231(a)(1). In defining “material that is harmful to minors,” COPA draws on the three-part obscenity test set forth in Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, see §231(e)(6), and thus requires jurors to apply “contemporary community standards” in assessing material, see §231(e)(6)(A). Respondents–who post or have members that post sexually oriented material on the Web–filed a facial challenge before COPA went into effect, claiming, inter alia, that the statute violated adults’ First Amendment rights because it effectively banned constitutionally protected speech, was not the least restrictive means of accomplishing a compelling governmental purpose, and was substantially overbroad. The District Court issued a preliminary injunction barring the enforcement of COPA because it concluded that the statute was unlikely to survive strict scrutiny. The Third Circuit affirmed but based its decision on a ground not relied upon by the District Court: that COPA’s use of “contemporary community standards,” §231(e)(6)(A), to identify material that is harmful to minors rendered the statute substantially overbroad. Held: COPA’s reliance on “community standards” to identify what material “is harmful to minors” does not by itself render the statute substantially overbroad for First Amendment purposes. The Court, however, expresses no view as to whether COPA suffers from substantial overbreadth for reasons other than its use of community standards, whether the statute is unconstitutionally vague, or whether the statute survives strict scrutiny. Prudence dictates allowing the Third Circuit to first examine these difficult issues. Because petitioner did not ask to have the preliminary injunction vacated, and because this Court could not do so without addressing matters the Third Circuit has yet to consider, the Government remains enjoined from enforcing COPA absent further action by the lower courts.

{"case_content": "Cell site simulators impersonate a wireless service provider’s cell tower, prompting cell phones and other wireless devices in the area to communicate with them. The devices are commonly used in two ways: to collect unique numeric identifiers associated with phones in a given area in order to identify the phones and their users, and to ascertain the location of a phone when agents know its unique numeric identifier but not its precise location. Although numerous law enforcement agencies across the country have released significant information about their use of cell site simulators in recent years, little information is publicly known about the use of cell site simulators by ICE and CBP or what safeguardsare in place to prevent abuse.Both uses of the technology raise serious issues under the Fourth Amendment. Collecting unique identifiers of all phones in an area necessarily results in collection of the location data of many bystanders. And using cell site simulators to ascertain the whereabouts of a specific cell phone can reveal the potentially sensitive location of its owner, including that they are in a constitutionally protected place, such as a home. Even when a cell site simulator is used to locate a particular suspect’s phone, it necessarily solicits identifying information from bystanders’ phones. They may also interfere with nearby cellphones’ connection to the cellular network, meaning they can affect not only the intended target but also bystanders.In 2017, theDetroit Newspublished an article detailing ICE’s use of a cell site simulator to locate an individual for arrest and prosecution on immigration-related charges. The article left unanswered a number of questions about what kinds of investigations immigration and border enforcement authorities use cell site simulators in, how often the technology is used, and what policies and practices constrain those uses.In order to answer these and related questions, the ACLU submitted its FOIA Request to CBP and ICE on May 19, 2017, seeking ten categories of records about the agencies’ acquisition and use of cell site simulators. For more than two years, the ACLU awaited responsive records from both CBP and ICE, to no avail.On December 11, 2019 — shortly after a revelatory article published byUnivisiondetailing ICE's use of the technology to locate an individual for arrest and prosecution on immigration-related charges — ACLU sued both CBP and ICE for failing to promptly make available requested records.This case is ongoing in the Southern District of New York.SEE DOCUMENTS RELEASED UNDER THIS LAWSUITSEE ORIGINAL 5/19/17 FOIA REQUEST", "norm_type": "prohibit", "sender": ["ICE", "CBP", "ACLU"], "sender_role": ["Advocate", "Government Agency"], "recipient": ["ICE", "CBP"], "recipient_role": ["Government Agency"], "subject": ["Individuals located by cell site simulators"], "subject_role": ["Individual"], "information_type": ["Location data", "Phone identifiers"], "purpose": "Investigation, enforcement of immigration-related laws", "sender_is_subject": "NO", "violated_articles": ["Fourth Amendment (Protection against unreasonable searches and seizures) and FOIA (failure to provide timely information)"], "consent_form": ["None"], "followed_articles": []}

FRT results are fundamentally unreliable and display higher rates of false matches for people of color, women, and young adults. Moreover, because FRT systems are designed to find similar-looking faces, even when the technology gets it wrong, the result is likely to look similar to the suspect. A photo lineup array containing an innocent false-match “döppelganger” generated by FRT surrounded by filler photos that necessarily look less like the suspect is impermissibly suggestive and can lead the witness to wrongly select the innocent person chosen by FRT.

{"case_content": "In 2015, during a DUI arrest, the defendant in this case consented to the government collecting a sample of his blood solely to test it for blood-alcohol content, and was advised that the sample would be destroyed after 90 days. Instead, law enforcement held on to this sample forthree years,at which point it used it for a completely different purpose—to extract and analyze the appellee’s DNA, without a warrant or consent—while investigating another crime.Given the revealing nature of DNA, collecting and analyzing it constitutes a seizure and a search under the Fourth Amendment. Our DNA contains some of our most private and sensitive information—ancestry, family relationships, propensities for serious medical conditions, and more. When combined with other public data, it can also expose previously unknown family histories of adoptions, misattributed paternity, or early mortality. The government must therefore obtain a warrant to search or seize DNA. A person’s limited consent to a search of biological material for a specific purpose—in this case, a blood alcohol test for a DUI arrest—does not overcome that requirement.After the ACLU and the ACLU of Arizona filed a brief and joined oral argument as amici in the appellate court, that court held that the search was unconstitutional because it exceeded the scope of the defendant’s consent. Nonetheless, it also concluded that the trial court should not have suppressed the resulting DNA evidence because the government would have lawfully obtained it in other ways.The Arizona Supreme Court granted review of that decision. The ACLU and the ACLU of Arizona filed an amicus curiae brief urging the court to reject the State’s arguments that the search was constitutional to begin with, and affirm the trial court’s decision to suppress the evidence. The brief underscores how extraction and analysis of the highly personal and sensitive information stored in a person’s DNA, without a warrant and beyond the scope of consent, is unlawful. The brief also emphasizes that accepting the State’s arguments in this case—that it can obtain DNA profiles from any biological sample in its lawful possession without any court oversight or approval—would mean that law enforcement could genetically test everything from blood samples taken from newborn babies to identify life-threatening diseases to the organ’s individuals have donated for transplant.

{"case_content": "We have a right to strong privacy protections when police seek, obtain, and execute search warrants for digital information, especially because what we store on on our phones, on other digital devices, and in online accounts is so comprehensive and revealing. The Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution is the primary source of protection for this right, but courts' interpretations of what the Fourth Amendment requires for digital-age warrants to be constitutional have sometimes fallen short. Just as with analog \"papers\" and \"effects,\" warrants seeking access to our digital records must prevent against the reviled \"general searches\" that motivated the Fourth Amendment's framing. If anything, the sensitive and intermingled nature of digitally stored information calls for amoreprotective reading of the warrant requirement, not a relaxed one. The affordances of modern technology must not be allowed to give police license to rummage indiscriminately through our private data for any cause (or no cause at all) and without judicial oversight. Instead, modern day warrants should provide robust protection against overbroad access to our digital information. Firmly established case law, Fourth Amendment first principles, and the practical realities of forensic searches all support this result, and a growing number of courts have recognized that warrants can adequately protect our in privacy interests in digitally stored information without hindering law enforcement from conducting legitimate investigations.This paper identifies features of electronically stored data that pose novel problems for our Fourth Amendment rights, and highlights how current search-warrant practice falls short.

They also demonstrate that several fusion centers and state and local law enforcement agencies have resisted using eGuardian because of concern over whether the system has an approved privacy policy, whether it is adequate in light of state and local laws protecting privacy, the general lack of guidance on the system, and the lengthy retention of data in eGuardian.Finally, the documents show that nationwide suspicious activity reporting programs use vague and expansive definitions for \"suspicious activity\" that have caused persistent confusion among federal, state, and local law enforcement.

Mr. Williams’ was the firstpublicly reported instanceof a false face-recognition “match” leading to a person’s wrongful arrest.After a shoplifter allegedly stole several watches at a Shinola store in Detroit in 2018, officers with the Detroit Police Department tried to identify the thief by capturing a blurry, low-quality still image from the store’s surveillance video and sending it to the Michigan State Police to run a face recognition technology search. The face recognition search returned a a possible match to an expired driver’s license photo of Mr. Williams. But the match was dead wrong: Mr. Williams was plainly not the man in the security footage and was nowhere near the store at the time of the alleged theft. Nevertheless, police used Mr. Williams’ photo to construct a photo lineup array, which they presented to an off-site Shinola loss-prevention contractor­—someone who was not there on the day of the theft and whose only knowledge of the incident stemmed from watching the same poor-quality surveillance footage that was used to generate the incorrect face recognition result.A detective with the Detroit Police Department then applied for an arrest warrant, but omitted significant information from the warrant application that would have put the magistrate on notice that neither the face recognition technology result nor the subsequent photo lineup procedure were reliable.In April 2021, the ACLU, ACLU of Michigan, and University of Michigan Law School’s Civil Rights Litigation Initiative filed a civil-rights lawsuit on Mr. Williams’ behalf against the individual detective responsible for his arrest, the City of Detroit, and Detroit’s Chief of Police. The lawsuit alleged that the detective, through his omissions in the warrant application, misled the magistrate judge, resulting in issuance of an arrest warrant without the required probable cause. It also alleged what discovery in Mr. Williams’ case andseveral more recent facial-recognition false arrestsin Detroit have since made obvious: That the city lacked any policy for law enforcement use of face recognition technology at the time the technology was used in this case, and that Detroit failed to train its police officers on the dangers of misusing face recognition technology in their investigations.On June 28, 2024, the parties in this case formalized a groundbreakingsettlement agreement, concluding the lawsuit and achieving the nation’s strongest police department policies constraining law enforcement’s use of face recognition technology.

However, robust audit testing and investigations to uncover online discrimination require violating common website terms of service.The CFAA’s “exceeds authorized access” provision delegates power to private websites to set terms of service that are then enforced through the criminal law. Many common website terms of service prohibit such activities as gathering or recording publicly available information, creating multiple accounts, or providing false information, even though these activities are often necessary for robust audit testing to uncover discrimination on the internet.In the offline world, audit testing has long been recognized as a crucial way to uncover racial discrimination in housing and employment, and to vindicate civil rights laws such as the Fair Housing Act and Title VII’s prohibition on discrimination in employment. Courts and Congress have long encouraged such socially useful testing and investigations.In the online world, however, conducting the same kind of audit testing can subject individuals to prosecution under the CFAA.

The Court will consider whether sites lose that immunity when they “recommend” content to their users—a practice undertaken by virtually all social media platforms.

Every time one does a Google search, Google “recommends” content by the order it lists its responses. The same is true for YouTube, which recommends similar videos based on a user’s choice of what to watch. If that sort of generic algorithmic recommendation is sufficient to deprive platforms of immunity, Section 230 will be rendered meaningless. And in the absence of immunity, platforms will be incentivized to censor lawful content or to feature only speech of little interest or value to users, contrary to the goals of Section 230.On May 18, 2023, the Supreme Court noted that in light of its decision inTwitter v. Taamneh, “little if any” of the plaintiffs’ case remained viable. It was therefore unnecessary to address the question of whether Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act immunized the platform’s recommendation algorithms. The Court remanded the case to the court of appeals to determine whether any part of the plaintiffs’ argument could move forward in light of theTwitterruling.", "norm_type": "permit", "sender": ["Google", "ACLU"], "sender_role": ["Legal Advocate", "Platform"], "recipient": ["Court of Appeals", "Supreme Court"], "recipient_role": ["Judiciary"], "subject": ["Plaintiffs", "Social Media Users"], "subject_role": ["Plaintiff", "User"], "information_type": ["Content", "Legal Argument"], "purpose": "Legal Proceedings", "sender_is_subject": "Not Sure", "violated_articles": [], "consent_form": ["null"], "followed_articles": ["null"]}

{"case_content": "All of the patients received genetic testing from Myriad Genetics in order to determine their hereditary risk for various forms of cancer and guide treatment decisions.  The patients later filed requests with Myriad for all of their genetic information.  Myriad denied their requests in March 2016, refusing to provide any genetic information beyond what is contained in the report of the test results.  The test reports do not include information about genetic variants that Myriad has identified in the patients and classified as benign.The patients want full access to their genetic information because they know that the understanding of genes and their variants is constantly evolving, and they want to be able to proactively monitor their own cancer risk and that of their family members as scientific knowledge and clinical interpretation of genomic information advances.  Most importantly, the patients, many of whom have uncommon genetic variants, are concerned that Myriad controls much of the data about BRCA1 and BRCA2 genetic variants in a proprietary database.  This impedes the ability of researchers to better understand whether these variants are connected with various types of cancer.  The patients want to have the option of sharing their data with the broader research community.On May 18, on the eve of the filing of the complaint, Myriad provided the four patients with genetic information it previously withheld.  However, it did so without rescinding its prior position that patients are not entitled to this data.The complaint asserts past and ongoing violations by Myriad of patients’ rights to access their health information under HIPAA and seeks an investigation by the HHS Office for Civil Rights, which enforces the law.Profiles of Patients Who Filed the ComplaintBarbara Zeughauser and Ken Deutsch:Barbara Zeughauser and Ken Deutsch are cousins with an extensive history of cancers in their family, including breast, ovarian, lung, and pancreatic cancers.  Barbara’s mother died of breast cancer and had a brother, Ken’s father, who died of pancreatic cancer.  Their shared grandmother also died of pancreatic cancer.Barbara is a 63-year-old woman living in Maryland, who is retired from her career as a law firm administrator.  She obtained testing of her BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes from Myriad Genetics in 2009 and tested positive for an uncommon deleterious BRCA1 mutation.Ken is a 54-year-old man living in Massachusetts who works in public relations.  He was diagnosed with metastatic bladder cancer in 2014 and tested positive through Myriad for the same deleterious mutation as Barbara.   The test result helped guide his treatment decisions.Both Barbara and Ken want access to their genomic data in order to contribute to research initiatives.In Barbara’s words:  \"I saw so many family members lost to cancer.  Understanding that there was a genetic cause was a gift to our children.  It is so senseless not to share this important data outside of our family.\"In Ken’s words:  \"There’s a misunderstanding out there – not every BRCA1 variant is the same.  We need a deeper understanding of what each of these mutations mean and whether and how they are connected to cancer.  As a cancer patient myself, it outrages me that a laboratory could stop patients from sharing their information with the scientific community.  Who knows how more research and knowledge about this could affect other families?\"AnneMarie Ciccarella:AnneMarie Ciccarella is a woman in her 50s living in New York who was diagnosed with breast cancer ten years ago.  In 2006, AnneMarie was tested through Myriad and received a test report indicating a variant of uncertain significance on her BRCA1 gene and another variant of uncertain significance on her BRCA2 gene.  Her experience with cancer led her to become a patient advocate, sitting on a number of scientific advisory boards.  AnneMarie believes that patients’ voices and perspectives should be included in all aspects of research and medical care.In AnneMarie’s words:  \"It makes me furious thinking that a laboratory is keeping my own genetic information from me.  My breast cancer treatment was a series of one painstaking decision after another, and today my mother is dealing with metastatic breast cancer.  If we want to empower patients, they should have the right to their own data so that they can keep track of new scientific developments and contribute it to research.\"Runi Limary:Runi Limary is a 39-year-old Asian-American woman living in Austin, TX, who works in the non-profit field.  She was diagnosed with aggressive breast cancer when she was 28 years old.  She obtained genetic testing from Myriad in 2007 and received a report indicating a BRCA1 genetic variant of uncertain significance.  She was told the variant had been seen in only a few other women, also of Asian descent.  She was one of the twenty plaintiffs whochallenged the patentingof the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, resulting in a unananimous 2013 U.S. Supreme Court striking down patents on genes because they claimed products of nature.In Runi’s words:  \"I care deeply about patients being able to access their own genetic data to make the best decisions for themselves.  Knowledge is power.  I was constantly worried because of the uncertainty of my test result.  A laboratory shouldn’t be able to stop me from accessing my own data to share with researchers who could be reaching a deeper understanding of these genes.  I also know there is less data out there on people who are racial minorities.  It’s important that there be responsible, public sharing of data so that everyone who gets genetic testing receives the best medical interpretation possible.\"Supporting Experts and OrganizationsTania Simoncelli, Senior Advisor to the Director of theBroad Institute of MIT and HarvardHeidi Rehm, PhD, Director of the Laboratory for Molecular Medicine at Partners Healthcare Personalized Medicine and Associate Professor of Pathology at Harvard Medical School and Brigham & Women’s HospitalLetter of SupportGlobal Alliance of Genomics & Health, with more than 400 organizational members and more than 600 individual members from around the globeLetter of SupportBreast Cancer Action, a national education and activist organizationLetter of support", "norm_type": "permit", "sender": ["Myriad Genetics"], "sender_role": ["Genetic Testing Company"], "recipient": ["Patients (Barbara Zeughauser, Ken Deutsch, AnneMarie Ciccarella, Runi Limary)"], "recipient_role": ["Patients"], "subject": ["AnneMarie Ciccarella", "Barbara Zeughauser", "Runi Limary", "Ken Deutsch"], "subject_role": ["Patients"], "information_type": ["Genetic Data"], "purpose": "Research, Personal Monitoring, Medical Decisions", "sender_is_subject": "Not Sure", "violated_articles": [], "consent_form": ["null"], "followed_articles": ["HIPAA - Right to Access Health Information"]}
{"case_content": "Respondent Wardlow fled upon seeing a caravan of police vehicles converge on an area of Chicago known for heavy narcotics trafficking. When Officers Nolan and Harvey caught up with him on the street, Nolan stopped him and conducted a protective pat-down search for weapons because in his experience there were usually weapons in the vicinity of narcotics transactions. Discovering a handgun, the officers arrested Wardlow. The Illinois trial court denied his motion to suppress, finding the gun was recovered during a lawful stop and frisk. He was convicted of unlawful use of a weapon by a felon. In reversing, the State Appellate Court found that Nolan did not have reasonable suspicion to make the stop under Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1. The State Supreme Court affirmed, determining that sudden flight in a high crime area does not create a reasonable suspicion justifying a Terry stop because flight may simply be an exercise of the right to “go on one’s way,” see Florida v. Royer, 460 U.S. 491. Held: The officers’ actions did not violate the Fourth Amendment. This case, involving a brief encounter between a citizen and a police officer on a public street, is governed by Terry, under which an officer who has a reasonable, articulable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot may conduct a brief, investigatory stop. While “reasonable suspicion” is a less demanding standard than probable cause, there must be at least a minimal level of objective justification for the stop. An individual’s presence in a “high crime area,” standing alone, is not enough to support a reasonable, particularized suspicion of criminal activity, but a location’s characteristics are relevant in determining whether the circumstances are sufficiently suspicious to warrant further investigation, Adams v. Williams, 407 U.S. 143, 144, 147—148. In this case, moreover, it was also Wardlow’s unprovoked flight that aroused the officers’ suspicion. Nervous, evasive behavior is another pertinent factor in determining reasonable suspicion, e.g., United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, 422 U.S. 873, 885, and headlong flight is the consummate act of evasion. In reviewing the propriety of an officer’s conduct, courts do not have available empirical studies dealing with inferences from suspicious behavior, and this Court cannot reasonably demand scientific certainty when none exists. Thus, the reasonable suspicion determination must be based on commonsense judgments and inferences about human behavior. See United States v. Cortez, 449 U.S. 411, 418. Officer Nolan was justified in suspecting that Wardlow was involved in criminal activity, and, therefore, in investigating further. Such a holding is consistent with the decision in Florida v. Royer, supra, at 498, that an individual, when approached, has a right to ignore the police and go about his business. Unprovoked flight is the exact opposite of “going about one’s business.” While flight is not necessarily indicative of ongoing criminal activity, Terry recognized that officers can detain individuals to resolve ambiguities in their conduct, 392 U.S., at 30, and thus accepts the risk that officers may stop innocent people. If they do not learn facts rising to the level of probable cause, an individual must be allowed to go on his way. But in this case the officers found that Wardlow possessed a handgun and arrested him for violating a state law. The propriety of that arrest is not before the Court. Pp. 3—6. 183 Ill. 2d 306, 701 N. E. 2d 484, reversed and remanded. Rehnquist, C. J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which O’Connor, Scalia, Kennedy, and Thomas, JJ., joined.

{"case_content": "The highest local appeals court in Washington, D.C. — the district’s equivalent of a state supreme court — is considering a challenge to police use of a cell phone tracking device to locate a suspect without first obtaining a warrant.The device, known as a “cell site simulator” or a “Stingray,” tracks phones by mimicking cell towers, forcing phones in the area into broadcasting their identifying information.In 2013, the Metropolitan Police Department used a Stingray to track a suspect’s cell phone while investigating several sexual assaults and robberies, but officers did not obtain a warrant or any other court order before to using the device. Police were able to precisely locate the suspect, Prince Jones, sitting in his parked car on a busy street.The defense challenged the Stingray’s use before trial, and the lower court found that even if the police actions violated the Fourth Amendment, the evidence found in the car could still be used under the “inevitable discovery” doctrine.On appeal, the American Civil Liberties Union and the Electronic Frontier Foundation filed afriend-of-the-court briefarguing that police should be required to get a warrant before using a Stingray because the device can locate people’s cell phones with great precision, including inside of homes and other private spaces protected by the Fourth Amendment.

{"case_content": "PubPeer hosts anonymous discussion of scientific journal articles. A cancer scientist has sued several of those anonymous commenters for defamation and issued a subpoena to PubPeer demanding their identities. The ACLU – along with its Michigan affiliate and Jollymore Law Office, P.C. – challenged the subpoena, arguing that the First Amendment protects the anonymity of PubPeer’s commenters unless the plaintiff can make a preliminary showing of merit to his claims. In the motion to quash the subpoena, filed in December 2014, the ACLU argued that the plaintiff could not make that showing. In March 2015, a Michigan judge ruled that PubPeer is not required to unmask the commenters, save for one. Both parties requested a review by the Michigan Court of Appeals, which upheld the ruling in December 2016.The appeals court rightly concluded that expressing an opinion on the basis of disclosed facts cannot be defamatory as a matter of law, and that anonymous speakers therefore cannot be unmasked simply for making such statements. Based on the ruling, PubPeer does not have to expose anything about any user to the researcher.PubPeer’s website is just the most recent example of the value of anonymity. It was launched in 2012 by a group of scientists who felt that the merits of scientific research should be discussed openly, without fear of recrimination from other members of the scientific community. It has accomplished that mission principally by allowing the scientists who post on its site to do so anonymously. This provides them the freedom necessary to contribute candid comment and debate on research methods, developments, results, and new directions without fear that they might alienate colleagues, compromise their own careers, or poison their professional relationships. Shielded by that anonymity, PubPeer’s commenters have in turn produced a steady stream of discussion and debate of the work of their peers, at times resulting in the modification or retraction of high-profile research.The subpoena to PubPeer jeopardizes the anonymity essential to PubPeer’s mission and, importantly, protected by the First Amendment. The constitutional right to anonymity is not absolute, but it protects anonymous speakers from being unmasked unless those suing them can make out a preliminary showing of merit to their legal claims. That protection is essential to ensuring that the right to anonymity continues to serve – as the Supreme Court has long observed – as \"a shield from the tyranny of the majority.\"", "norm_type": "prohibit", "sender": ["Cancer scientist", "Michigan judge", "ACLU", "Michigan affiliate", "Jollymore Law Office, P.C."], "sender_role": ["Defendants' legal representatives", "Authority", "Plaintiff"], "recipient": ["Public", "PubPeer", "Court", "Anonymous commenters"], "recipient_role": ["Defendant", "Authority"], "subject": ["PubPeer's anonymous commenters"], "subject_role": ["Information provider"], "information_type": ["Identity information"], "purpose": "Defamation lawsuit", "sender_is_subject": "Not Sure", "violated_articles": ["First Amendment"], "consent_form": ["None"], "followed_articles": []}

{"case_content": "This case involves investigators’ attempt to introduce into evidence algorithmically generated frequent location history from an accused person’s iPhone through the proffered expert testimony of a crime analyst who explicitly disavowed knowledge of how the algorithm worked. At the time of the investigation, iPhones calculated and saved information about the locations a device visited more than once by compiling several distinct types of location data, including GPS data, information about Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connections, and data gleaned from the iPhone’s contact with nearby cell towers, running that data through a proprietary algorithm, and then displaying so-called “frequent location history” location points on a map as circles of varying sizes (sometimes with diameters representing hundreds of meters). The analyst attempted to establish the reliability of the frequent location history by testifying about his own tests on a different model of iPhone running a different version of Apple’s operating system, to show that after visiting a location several times with that device, the phone seemed to generate frequent location history reflecting that it had been in that general vicinity.The trial court excluded the analyst’s testimony on the basis that the analyst lacked the specialized knowledge required to qualify him as an expert witness, and had failed to adequately substantiate the reliability of the frequent location history evidence. The government appealed to Massachusetts’ high court.In an amicus brief in the case, the ACLU, along with the ACLU of Massachusetts, the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, the Massachusetts Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, and the Electronic Frontier Foundation, urged affirmance of the trial court’s order.

On November 30, 2012, the Supreme Court agreed to hear argument on the patentability of human genes. The ACLU argued the case before the U.S. Supreme Court on April 15, 2013. We expect a decision this summer.On behalf of researchers, genetic counselors, women patients, cancer survivors, breast cancer and women's health groups, and scientific associations representing 150,000 geneticists, pathologists, and laboratory professionals, we have argued that human genes cannot be patented because they are classic products of nature. The suit charges that the gene patents violate the First Amendment and stifle diagnostic testing and research that could lead to cures and that they limit women's options regarding their medical care.The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) has granted thousands of patents on human genes – in fact, about 20 percent of our genes are patented. A gene patent holder has the right to prevent anyone from studying, testing or even looking at a gene. As a result, scientific research and genetic testing has been delayed, limited or even shut down due to concerns about gene patents.The lawsuit was filed on behalf of researchers, genetic counselors, women patients, cancer survivors, breast cancer and women's health groups, and scientific associations representing 150,000 geneticists, pathologists, and laboratory professionals.

The database tracks prescriptions for medications needed to treat chronic and acute pain, anxiety and panic disorders, weight loss associated with AIDS, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, and other conditions, as well as the testosterone needed by many transgender men. Because the medical information revealed by these prescription records is highly sensitive, the legislature created robust privacy protections, which include the requirement that law enforcement obtain a warrant before requesting records for use in an investigation. However, the DEA has claimed that a federal statute allows them to access those records without obtaining a warrant from a judge.The State of Oregon sued in November in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon to prevent the DEA from circumventing Oregon law. In January 2013, the ACLU intervened in the suit to make sure that the constitutional rights of individual patients and doctors in Oregon are represented, arguing that the Fourth Amendment privacy rights of Oregonians are violated when the federal government can access their private medical information without first demonstrating any wrongdoing.", "norm_type": "prohibit", "sender": ["Oregon legislature", "DEA", "ACLU"], "sender_role": ["Legislator", "Advocacy Group", "Federal Agency"], "recipient": ["Oregon legislature", "DEA", "ACLU"], "recipient_role": ["Legislator", "Advocacy Group", "Federal Agency"], "subject": ["Oregonians (patients and doctors)"], "subject_role": ["Patient", "Doctor"], "information_type": ["Prescription Records"], "purpose": "Investigation, Protection of Constitutional Rights", "sender_is_subject": "Not Sure", "violated_articles": ["Fourth Amendment"], "consent_form": ["Authorization"], "followed_articles": []}
{"case_content": "In this case, federal agents installed a utility pole–mounted video camera directly in front of Bruce Hay’s home in Osawotomie, Kansas, capturing Mr. Hay’s porch, front yard, and driveway—areas sometimes referred to in legal language the “curtilage.” Agents used the camera to surveil Mr. Hay without a warrant for nearly ten weeks. During that period, officers could watch the camera’s feed in real time—or later, at their leisure—from the station, and could remotely pan, tilt, and zoom close enough to read license plates or detect what someone was carrying into or out of the house. From this, they could learn a great deal of sensitive information about Mr. Hay’s activities and associations.Mr. Hay moved to suppress the pole camera footage, arguing that because long-term, round-the-clock video surveillance of a person’s home reveals comprehensive and highly sensitive information, it constitutes a search under the Fourth Amendment. On May 5, 2022, the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas denied Mr. Hay’s request, ruling that circuit precedent foreclosed his arguments and that this kind of surveillance does not qualify as a search. In doing so, the district court acknowledged that the Supreme Court’s 2018 landmark decision inCarpenter v. United States, which held that acquisition of long-term, historical cell-site location information is a search requiring a warrant, might call for reconsideration of the Tenth Circuit’s outdated cases involving pole cameras.The ACLU filed a friend-of-the court brief on appeal, urging the Tenth Circuit to affirm that long-term, continuous pole camera surveillance of a person’s home and its curtilage, when conducted without a warrant, violates the Fourth Amendment right to be secure in our homes against unreasonable searches. Even though the exterior of a home is in public view, protracted surveillance over weeks can reveal patterns in a person’s activity and associations that can be just as sensitive as the historical cell site location information at issue inCarpenter. Over time, pole camera footage can disclose the identities of a person’s guests and visitors; whether someone other than their spouse visits at night (and how frequently); whether they regularly leave home with a protest sign or a prayer shawl; and, depending on the camera’s zoom capabilities, potentially whether they are holding documents such as medical bills or ballots. Government agents should not be able to access such extensive revealing information without judicial oversight.The ACLU’s brief also argues that authorizing warrantless, prolonged pole camera surveillance of a home would disadvantage those who lack the means to protect themselves against such surveillance. Our constitutional right to privacy should not hinge on our homeowner status or our ability erect expensive fencing tall enough to shield our homes from prying government eyes. But this is exactly the result that would flow from a decision declining to hold that the Constitution protects against the kind of surveillance that took place in this case.The ACLU of Colorado, the ACLU of Kansas, the Electronic Privacy Information Center, the Center for Democracy & Technology, and the Brennan Center for Justice joined the brief.United States v.

{"case_content": "The ACLU and its Utah affiliate filed a motion to intervene in a case between the federal Drug Enforcement Administration and the state of Utah over the DEA’s efforts to obtain confidential prescription records from a state database without a warrant. The court granted the motion in October and the case is continuing with the ACLU as a party.In 1996, Utah began tracking records of prescriptions for certain drugs dispensed by pharmacies, compiling these records into the Utah Controlled Substance Database (UCSD). Although the program was initially intended to help physicians prevent drug overdoses and abuse by their patients, it was discovered in 2014 that a Utah detective used the UCSD to access all 480 employees of Utah’s largest fire agency without judicial oversight, and improperly charged at least two employees with crimes they did not commit. In response, Utah’s legislature in March 2015 amended the law that regulates access to the UCSD, requiring law enforcement officers to obtain a probable cause warrant from a court before they can gain access to the database.Despite Utah’s law requiring a warrant, the DEA has been using administrative subpoenas to request access to drug records in Utah’s prescription database. Unlike a search warrant issued by a neutral magistrate upon a finding of probable cause, an administrative subpoena is granted based on a much lower standard -- it can be issued by the government when an agent merely believes that the records will be “relevant or material” to an investigation.

{"case_content": "The Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996 (CPPA) expands the federal prohibition on child pornography to include not only pornographic images made using actual children, 18 U.S.C. § 2256(8)(A), but also “any visual depiction, including any photograph, film, video, picture, or computer or computer-generated image or picture” that “is, or appears to be, of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct,” §2256(8)(B), and any sexually explicit image that is “advertised, promoted, presented, described, or distributed in such a manner that conveys the impression” it depicts “a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct,” §2256(8)(D). Thus, §2256(8)(B) bans a range of sexually explicit images, sometimes called “virtual child pornography,” that appear to depict minors but were produced by means other than using real children, such as through the use of youthful-looking adults or computer-imaging technology. Section 2256(8)(D) is aimed at preventing the production or distribution of pornographic material pandered as child pornography. Fearing that the CPPA threatened their activities, respondents, an adult-entertainment trade association and others, filed this suit alleging that the “appears to be” and “conveys the impression” provisions are overbroad and vague, chilling production of works protected by the First Amendment. The District Court disagreed and granted the Government summary judgment, but the Ninth Circuit reversed. Generally, pornography can be banned only if it is obscene under Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, but pornography depicting actual children can be proscribed whether or not the images are obscene because of the State’s interest in protecting the children exploited by the production process, New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747, 758, and in prosecuting those who promote such sexual exploitation, id., at 761. The Ninth Circuit held the CPPA invalid on its face, finding it to be substantially overbroad because it bans materials that are neither obscene under Miller nor produced by the exploitation of real children as in Ferber. Held: The prohibitions of §§2256(8)(B) and 2256(8)(D) are overbroad and unconstitutional. Pp. 6—21. (a) Section 2256(8)(B) covers materials beyond the categories recognized in Ferber and Miller, and the reasons the Government offers in support of limiting the freedom of speech have no justification in this Court’s precedents or First Amendment law. Pp. 6—19. (1) The CPPA is inconsistent with Miller. It extends to images that are not obscene under the Miller standard, which requires the Government to prove that the work in question, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest, is patently offensive in light of community standards, and lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value, 413 U.S., at 24. Materials need not appeal to the prurient interest under the CPPA, which proscribes any depiction of sexually explicit activity, no matter how it is presented. It is not necessary, moreover, that the image be patently offensive. Pictures of what appear to be 17-year-olds engaging in sexually explicit activity do not in every case contravene community standards. The CPPA also prohibits speech having serious redeeming value, proscribing the visual depiction of an idea–that of teenagers engaging in sexual activity–that is a fact of modern society and has been a theme in art and literature for centuries. A number of acclaimed movies, filmed without any child actors, explore themes within the wide sweep of the statute’s prohibitions. If those movies contain a single graphic depiction of sexual activity within the statutory definition, their possessor would be subject to severe punishment without inquiry into the literary value of the work. This is inconsistent with an essential First Amendment rule: A work’s artistic merit does not depend on the presence of a single explicit scene. See, e.g., Book Named “John Cleland’s Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure” v. Attorney General of Mass., 383 U.S. 413, 419. Under Miller, redeeming value is judged by considering the work as a whole. Where the scene is part of the narrative, the work itself does not for this reason become obscene, even though the scene in isolation might be offensive. See Kois v. Wisconsin, 408 U.S. 229, 231 (per curiam). The CPPA cannot be read to prohibit obscenity, because it lacks the required link between its prohibitions and the affront to community standards prohibited by the obscenity definition. Pp. 6—11. (2) The CPPA finds no support in Ferber. The Court rejects the Government’s argument that speech prohibited by the CPPA is virtually indistinguishable from material that may be banned under Ferber. That case upheld a prohibition on the distribution and sale of child pornography, as well as its production, because these acts were “intrinsically related” to the sexual abuse of children in two ways. 458 U.S., at 759. First, as a permanent record of a child’s abuse, the continued circulation itself would harm the child who had participated. See id., at 759, and n. 10. Second, because the traffic in child pornography was an economic motive for its production, the State had an interest in closing the distribution network. Id., at 760. Under either rationale, the speech had what the Court in effect held was a proximate link to the crime from which it came. In contrast to the speech in Ferber, speech that is itself the record of sexual abuse, the CPPA prohibits speech that records no crime and creates no victims by its production. Virtual child pornography is not “intrinsically related” to the sexual abuse of children. While the Government asserts that the images can lead to actual instances of child abuse, the causal link is contingent and indirect. The harm does not necessarily follow from the speech, but depends upon some unquantified potential for subsequent criminal acts. The Government’s argument that these indirect harms are sufficient because, as Ferber acknowledged, child pornography rarely can be valuable speech, see id., at 762, suffers from two flaws. First, Ferber’s judgment about child pornography was based upon how it was made, not on what it communicated. The case reaffirmed that where the speech is neither obscene nor the product of sexual abuse, it does not fall outside the First Amendment’s protection. See id., at 764—765. Second, Ferber did not hold that child pornography is by definition without value. It recognized some works in this category might have significant value, see id., at 761, but relied on virtual images–the very images prohibited by the CPPA–as an alternative and permissible means of expression, id., at 763. Because Ferber relied on the distinction between actual and virtual child pornography as supporting its holding, it provides no support for a statute that eliminates the distinction and makes the alternative mode criminal as well. Pp. 11—13. (3) The Court rejects other arguments offered by the Government to justify the CPPA’s prohibitions. The contention that the CPPA is necessary because pedophiles may use virtual child pornography to seduce children runs afoul of the principle that speech within the rights of adults to hear may not be silenced completely in an attempt to shield children from it. See, e.g., Sable Communications of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115, 130—131. That the evil in question depends upon the actor’s unlawful conduct, defined as criminal quite apart from any link to the speech in question, establishes that the speech ban is not narrowly drawn. The argument that virtual child pornography whets pedophiles’ appetites and encourages them to engage in illegal conduct is unavailing because the mere tendency of speech to encourage unlawful acts is not a sufficient reason for banning it, Stanley v. Georgia, 394 U.S. 557, 566, absent some showing of a direct connection between the speech and imminent illegal conduct, see, e.g., Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444, 447 (per curiam). The argument that eliminating the market for pornography produced using real children necessitates a prohibition on virtual images as well is somewhat implausible because few pornographers would risk prosecution for abusing real children if fictional, computerized images would suffice. Moreover, even if the market deterrence theory were persuasive, the argument cannot justify the CPPA because, here, there is no underlying crime at all. Finally, the First Amendment is turned upside down by the argument that, because it is difficult to distinguish between images made using real children and those produced by computer imaging, both kinds of images must be prohibited. The overbreadth doctrine prohibits the Government from banning unprotected speech if a substantial amount of protected speech is prohibited or chilled in the process. See Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 612. The Government’s rejoinder that the CPPA should be read not as a prohibition on speech but as a measure shifting the burden to the accused to prove the speech is lawful raises serious constitutional difficulties. The Government misplaces its reliance on §2252A(c), which creates an affirmative defense allowing a defendant to avoid conviction for nonpossession offenses by showing that the materials were produced using only adults and were not otherwise distributed in a manner conveying the impression that they depicted real children. Even if an affirmative defense can save a statute from First Amendment challenge, here the defense is insufficient because it does not apply to possession or to images created by computer imaging, even where the defendant could demonstrate no children were harmed in producing the images. Thus, the defense leaves unprotected a substantial amount of speech not tied to the Government’s interest in distinguishing images produced using real children from virtual ones. Pp. 13—19. (b) Section 2256(8)(D) is also substantially overbroad. The Court disagrees with the Government’s view that the only difference between that provision and §2256(8)(B)’s “appears to be” provision is that §2256(8)(D) requires the jury to assess the material at issue in light of the manner in which it is promoted, but that the determination would still depend principally upon the prohibited work’s content. The “conveys the impression” provision requires little judgment about the image’s content; the work must be sexually explicit, but otherwise the content is irrelevant. Even if a film contains no sexually explicit scenes involving minors, it could be treated as child pornography if the title and trailers convey the impression that such scenes will be found in the movie. The determination turns on how the speech is presented, not on what is depicted. The Government’s other arguments in support of the CPPA do not bear on §2256(8)(D). The materials, for instance, are not likely to be confused for child pornography in a criminal trial. Pandering may be relevant, as an evidentiary matter, to the question whether particular materials are obscene. See Ginzburg v. United States, 383 U.S. 463, 474. Where a defendant engages in the “commercial exploitation” of erotica solely for the sake of prurient appeal, id., at 466, the context created may be relevant to evaluating whether the materials are obscene. Section 2256(8)(D), however, prohibits a substantial amount of speech that falls outside Ginzburg’s rationale. Proscribed material is tainted and unlawful in the hands of all who receive it, though they bear no responsibility for how it was marketed, sold, or described. The statute, furthermore, does not require that the context be part of an effort at “commercial exploitation.” Thus, the CPPA does more than prohibit pandering. It bans possession of material pandered as child pornography by someone earlier in the distribution chain, as well as a sexually explicit film that contains no youthful actors but has been packaged to suggest a prohibited movie. Possession is a crime even when the possessor knows the movie was mislabeled. The First Amendment requires a more precise restriction. Pp. 19—20. (c) In light of the foregoing, respondents’ contention that §§2256(8)(B) and 2256(8)(D) are void for vagueness need not be addressed. P. 21. 198 F.3d 1083, affirmed. Kennedy, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer, JJ., joined. Thomas, J., filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.

{"case_content": "After George Floyd was murdered by Minneapolis police in May 2020, millions of people across the United States protested police brutality for months in one of thelargestseries of social demonstrations in national history. Throughout this period,federalaerial surveillance tools, including drones, helicopters, and spy planes, monitored at least 15citieswhere people were protesting. According to press reports, individual planes gathered as much as 58hoursof footage in a single stretch, with at least 270hoursof total footage being collected across all the cities.One spy plane that flew overMinneapolishad the ability to obtain high-resolution footage from an unusually high distance, making it less noticeable from the ground—and a group that tried to shine a laser at the plane was locatedwithin 20 minutes and surrounded by police. Another plane—which had also been previously deployed in 2015 over Baltimore, during protests following Freddie Gray’sdeathin police custody—surveilled protests inWashington, D.C., and was equipped to “monitor targets day and night, see through haze, and provide infrared thermal imaging.”The ACLU of Northern  California recently published publicrecordsregarding aerial surveillance last summer by the California Highway Patrol, including footage that zooms in on individual faces and records personal interactions between people, along with general surveillance of community activity.

{"case_content": "In April 2024, Mississippi’s governor signed HB 1126 into law. If allowed to go into effect, the law would require users of social media services to verify their age by providing personal data such as a government-issued photo ID. The law would also mandate that services prohibit anyone deemed to be a minor from joining without parental consent, and that they censor or otherwise limit those people’s access to a variety of vaguely-defined topics deemed harmful.This legislation comes on the heels of a similar wave of legislation across the country that seeks to require social media sites to age-gate their services, as well as aset of lawsthat purport to shield minors from explicit content. In reality, these laws impermissibly burden all users’ ability to access Internet spaces and express themselves online, and can in fact harm kids by making it impossible for them to learn about the world, petition government actors, and build community.In recognition of the laws’ unconstitutional obstacle to access, courts have consistently struck down online age verification mandates for access to social media, as well as laws requiring parental consent for minors to access Internet content. Courts have ruled that when less restrictive alternatives exist, governments must make use of them.In their brief, the ACLU and its co-authors detail the “chilling effect” that age verification mandates would have on people who use social media, and the privacy implications inherent in requiring individuals to hand over personal information as a precondition for access. Individuals lacking suitable government identification, a group that disproportionately includes Black, Hispanic, disabled, and low-income Americans, could find themselves blocked from accessing social media services.

{"case_content": "The California legislature largely framed the California Age-Appropriate Design-Code Act (“CAADCA”) as a consumer privacy law that would offer stronger privacy protections by default. This is an important goal that lawmakers can and should achieve without violating the constitution. But the CAADCA’s text makes clear that it is in fact an impermissible, content-based regulation of online speech, and it fails strict scrutiny. The First Amendment precludes such a law. At the same time, the CAADCA contains several privacy concepts that, in another law, could be subject to and satisfy a lower level of First Amendment scrutiny.On February 14, 2024, the ACLU and ACLU of Northern California filed an amicus brief in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit explaining the CAADCA’s constitutional defects, but urging the court to rule narrowly and recognize that a different consumer privacy law could pass constitutional muster. The brief canvases the many harms that can flow from private actors’ collection, aggregation, use, and sharing of people’s sensitive information, and the vital role consumer privacy laws could play in preventing or remediating those harms. It then discusses avenues that legislators can take to protect consumer privacy without infringing free speech. Finally, it explains why the CAADCA in particulardoestrench on free speech and should remain enjoined.Electronic devices and services are essential to participating in modern life. We use them to communicate with each other, record our thoughts, and access everything from transportation to health care to education. But the businesses behind these technologies often collect, share, and use our personal information in ways we never agree to, potentially leading to discrimination, security breaches, loss of privacy, and other harms.Legislators have tools at their disposal to pass consumer privacy laws that effectively address these harms without running afoul of the First Amendment. For example, they can regulate the use and sharing of personal data obtained solely in exchange for a good or service. Such legislation would likely trigger—and pass—a lower level of constitutional scrutiny than does the CAADCA. Similarly, laws mandating disclosure of when a business is tracking consumers, such as those requiring notification when a user’s GPS location is collected, are likely to survive First Amendment challenge.However, the CAADCA is not such a law. It purports to regulate privacy harms, but instead prohibits and burdens online speech based on its content. It bans businesses from “[u]sing [any child’s] personal information” in a way that is “materially detrimental” to them, reaching online speech both to and about children based on its potential to cause harm, anguish, or distress to any child. And the CAADCA burdens online communication by requiring businesses to evaluate the risk that any new service or feature will expose children to “harmful, or potentially harmful, content,” “contacts,” “conduct,” or “algorithms.” Online businesses must also create a “timed plan to mitigate or eliminate th[at] risk before” children access the online service or feature. Since these reports must be completed before any new service or feature is implemented or made publicly available, the CAADCA in effect delays user access to new platforms or ways of speaking online as well as platforms’ implementation of new content moderation policies. Further, in part because the terms “material detriment,” “harmful,” and “potentially harmful” are all left undefined, the CAADCA could lead platforms to enact more speech restrictive content moderation policies or ban certain content entirely in an effort to comply with the law.Well-settled Supreme Court precedent establishes that the government may not ban or burden speech just to shield young people from ideas or images that the government might think unsuitable for them. While speech confronting, discussing, and working through painful daily realities, such as parental abuse or depression, can pose difficulties for children, this speech is constitutionally protected and often valuable. Even where speech lacks obvious value, the Court has ruled that First Amendment protection generally does not turn on that. The Court has also held that the government may not limit adults’ access to speech in the name of protecting children. The CAADCA falls short of what the First Amendment requires on each of these grounds.The ACLU has long advocated that strong protections for online speech are necessary to ensure the First Amendment’s vitality in the digital age.

{"case_content": "The executive order, signed by President Reagan in 1981 and modified many times since, is the authority relied upon by intelligence agencies, including the NSA, to conduct surveillance of foreigners outside the United States. According to media reports, however, the government also relies on the executive order to sweep up the international communications of countless Americans. For example, it collects billions of records every day containing the location information of mobile phones, including Americans' phones; to harvest the address books of email users; and to sweep up the information of users of Google and Yahoo as it travels between those companies' data centers abroad.The ACLU's lawsuit seeks information about the legal boundaries of surveillance conducted under Executive Order 12,333, and privacy protections for Americans whose communications are ensnared in this surveillance. Because the law concerning Executive Order 12,333 is made almost entirely within the executive branch, it is especially critical that the public understands how the executive branch interprets the protections it claims exist.After the ACLU filed suit in 2013, the government released more than a hundred documents in full or in part. However, it kept secret scores of documents, including key legal analysis interpreting its surveillance powers under the executive order. In 2017, the district court in the case agreed that the government could keep those documents secret. The ACLU appealed the district court’s ruling concerning eight critical documents: two memoranda that provided the legal basis for President George W. Bush’s warrantless wiretapping program, and six surveillance “approval packages,” which contain memoranda setting out the legal basis for Executive Order 12,333 surveillance activities.

The Supreme Court of New Jersey held that the Fifth Amendment privilege does not protect him from being compelled to communicate his memorized passcodes to the government, ruling that the privilege was overcome because the passcodes’ existence, possession, and authentication were “foregone conclusions.”With this petition on behalf of Mr. Andrews, the ACLU and the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), along with New Jersey-based Tarver Law Offices, urge the U.S. Supreme Court to ensure the Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination extends to the digital age by prohibiting law enforcement from forcing individuals to disclose their phone and computer passcodes.

{"case_content": "On January 30, 2023, the ACLU filed an amicus brief, with the Center for Taxpayer Rights and two law school clinics, in support of petitioners inPolselli v. Internal Revenue Service.The IRS has broad power to seek records to carry out its myriad investigatory, collections, and other duties. But those powers need checks to guard against abuse or inadvertent infringements on privacy. The statute at issue in this case, 26 U.S.C. § 7609, requires that certain parties be notified when the IRS seeks their record from third parties, in order to give those individuals an opportunity to challenge the validity of the request. It was enacted as a safeguard for privacy. The ACLU urges the Supreme Court to interpret it in a way that preserves its purpose by requiring notice except in specific situations, and to reject the IRS’s interpretation, which would render the notice requirement inapplicable in virtually all IRS investigations.Congress enacted § 7609 to protect the right to privacy from government intrusion without unduly interfering with tax collection. The provision generally requires that when the IRS issues a summons seeking an individual’s records from some third party, such as a bank or accountant, it must provide notice of the summons to identified persons. For example, if the IRS seeks bank records in the course of an audit, it generally must also notify the account holder of the summons. The statute then gives the account holder a brief window to challenge the summons based on recognized privileges and defenses, such as lack of relevance or the attorney-client privilege.The statute includes exceptions that deny notice in certain circumstances, and only persons entitled to notice have a right to challenge the summons. But those exceptions are narrow. Yet the IRS reads one of the exceptions to apply whenever it is pursuing collection of taxes, an exception that would apply in almost every instance, and would render the statute a dead letter. If that reading is accepted, innocent third parties will have no opportunity to assert fundamental privileges and protections in order to preserve their privacy, the whole purpose of the notice requirement.This case strikes at the heart of privacy rights that Congress specifically created in response to IRS overreaches. The scope of this exception determines whether individuals or entities have a meaningful right to keep their private information out of the IRS’s hands.On May 18, 2023, the Supreme Court affirmed that the IRS has authority to issue such a summons without prior notification to the account holder.", "norm_type": "prohibit", "sender": ["IRS"], "sender_role": ["Tax Authority"], "recipient": ["Account Holder", "Third Party (e.g., Bank or Accountant)"], "recipient_role": ["Individual/Organization Holding Private Records"], "subject": ["Account Holder"], "subject_role": ["Individual Whose Information is Being Sought"], "information_type": ["Private Financial Information (e.g., Bank Records)"], "purpose": "Tax Collection and Investigation", "sender_is_subject": "NO", "violated_articles": ["null"], "consent_form": ["null"], "followed_articles": []}
{"case_content": "Cell site simulators, also known as “Stingrays” or “IMSI catchers,” impersonate a wireless service provider’s cell tower, prompting cell phones and other wireless devices in the area to communicate with them. They can be used to locate, track, and identify people’s phones. Even when used to locate a particular suspect’s phone, cell site simulators collect unique numeric identifiers associated with all the phones in a given area, ensnaring bystanders’ phones in the search. Cell site simulators can also interfere with nearby cell phones’ connection to the cellular network.For years, law enforcement agencies hid their use of cell site simulators from judges, defendants, lawmakers, and the public. Before state and local law enforcement agencies purchased cell site simulators from a private vendor, the FBI would require them to sign nondisclosure agreements (NDAs) prohibiting the disclosure of their use to the public and to the courts. The ACLU, journalists, and others obtainedcopiesof the NDAs through public records requests, and the FBI’s secrecy policy was condemned bycourtsandadvocates.In 2020, Dell Cameron and Dhruv Mehrotra published anarticlerevealing that, after a major provider of cell site simulators (L3Harris Technologies, formerly the Harris Corporation), announced it would no longer sell cell site simulators to state and local law enforcement, those agencies were turning to a different company, Tactical Support Equipment (TSE), which sells cell site simulators manufactured by Octasic, a Canadian firm. In 2021, the ACLU filed a Freedom of Information Act request seeking recent nondisclosure agreements between the FBI and state or local law enforcement agencies pertaining to that agency’s purchase, use, or possession of cell site simulator technology, including from TSE. Five months later, the FBI responded that it “neither confirms nor denies” the existence of such records (known as a “Glomar response”). It was not until the ACLU appealed the FBI’s Glomar response and filed a complaint in the Southern District of New York that the FBI finally agreed to produce responsive records.Many of the records we received were created between 2011 and 2015, and offer additional examples of the FBI imposing nondisclosure agreements on state and local law enforcement agencies that sought to purchase or use cell cite simulators during that time. In the records we received that were created after 2018, there was nothing to suggest that the FBI has continued to impose nondisclosure agreements when state and local law enforcement agencies purchase theirowncell site simulators. These records do reveal, however, that the FBI continues to impose nondisclosure agreements on agencies seeking to use theFBI’scell site simulators. An FBI email from May 7, 2020, for example, states that individuals assigned to a particular investigation “read and acknowledged the FBI’s Nondisclosure agreement regarding the use of the cell site simulator.” And another email from May 14, 2020 relating to “a request for technical support” from the FBI under “exigent circumstances” provides recent NDA language. The recipient was asked to agree to several provisions, including:“The FBI must be contacted immediately if there is any request for, or intent to use publicly, any information relating to the assistance provided pursuant to this request;”“The FBI will use all appropriate legal means to limit testimony regarding the technology in any state or local proceeding;”“Information obtained through use of the equipment is FOR LEAD PURPOSES ONLY and may not be used as primary evidence in any affidavits, hearings, or trials;” and“[Y]our agency understands it is required to use additional and independent investigative means and methods . . . that would be admissible at trial to corroborate information concerning the location of the target obtained through use of this equipment.”This is all purportedly justified by the assertion that “[t]he equipment to be deployed is considered [Law Enforcement Sensitive], as disclosure of the capabilities of this technology may allow future subjects of investigations to employ countermeasures to avoid detection by law enforcement.” But the public, courts, and people accused of crimes deserve to know when the government is deploying invasive surveillance technologies, and when the FBI is going to great lengths to keep that surveillance secret.DOCUMENTS RELEASED UNDER THIS LAWSUITReleased June 1, 2022Release LetterFirst Batch of Released RecordsReleased June 30, 2022Release LetterSecond Batch of Released RecordsReleased April 4, 2023Negotiations between the ACLU and the FBI resulted in a supplemental production, in which the agency lifted certain prior redactions to a record released on June 1, 2022.Reprocessed Release (Final)", "norm_type": "prohibit", "sender": ["FBI"], "sender_role": ["law enforcement agency"], "recipient": ["State and local law enforcement agencies"], "recipient_role": ["law enforcement agencies"], "subject": ["General public, criminal suspects, bystanders"], "subject_role": ["suspects", "bystanders", "citizens"], "information_type": ["Unique numeric identifiers of phones, location data"], "purpose": "Surveillance and law enforcement investigations", "sender_is_subject": "NO", "violated_articles": ["**None**"], "consent_form": ["None"], "followed_articles": []}

{"case_content": "On April 5, 2024, the ACLU and its Nevada affiliate filed an amicus brief inUnited States v. Motley, a case that concerns law enforcement access to the prescription drug monitoring program databases that almost every state uses to monitor the prescription of controlled substances. The brief urges the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to reconsider a ruling by a three-judge panel of the same court which, if it is left standing, threatens to erode the privacy of our prescription drug records forallcontrolled substances—even though the three-judge panel purported to limit its holding to opioids.While some states require a warrant or a showing of probable cause before law enforcement personnel can access records in PMP databases, Nevada allows police to log into its PMP database directly and rummage around at their whim. That’s exactly what occurred in this case: In the course of a criminal investigation targeting an individual, police accessed records held by Nevada’s PMP with no warrant and no showing of probable cause, ultimately charging the defendant with conspiracy to distribute controlled substances.The defendant challenged the police’s warrantless access of his prescription records as a violation of his Fourth Amendment rights. But on appeal, the Ninth Circuit panel held that patients have no expectation of privacy—and thus, no Fourth Amendment interest—in their prescription records for medications that are classified as controlled substances.  Even though the panel tried to cabin its ruling to opioids, its reasoning threatens the privacy of prescription records forallcontrolled substances, including for many commonly prescribed medications for serious medical conditions. The ruling raises the prospect of unrestrained law enforcement access to private medical information capable of revealing a person’s diagnoses, confidential medical advice from their physician, chosen course of treatment, and even the stage or severity of their disorder or disease. This outcome not only can have devastating effects for innocent people, such as wrongful prosecutions and undermining the public health system, but it is also in tension with Supreme Court precedent subjecting some sensitive records to the warrant requirement even though they are held by third parties.The panel based its rationale on a narrow exception in Fourth Amendment law that allows for warrantless administrative inspections of business records, products, or premises in industries that are heavily regulated by the government. Specifically, the panel reasoned that the government’s “pervasive” regulation of prescription drugs like opioids takes away a patient’s expectation of privacy in their prescription records. But the exception the panel relied on is premised on the government’s need make unannounced inspections in order to effectively administer regulation in some specific industries, like the liquor and firearm industries. Unlike patients receiving prescriptions from a health-care provider, proprietors in these closely regulated industries conduct their business knowing that it is subject to effective inspection. The panel departed from the rationales underlying the pervasively regulated industry exception when it extended that exception beyond administrative inspections of businesses to criminal searches of patients’ private prescription records for the purposes of criminal prosecution.", "norm_type": "prohibit", "sender": ["Nevada Police"], "sender_role": ["Law Enforcement"], "recipient": ["Nevada Police"], "recipient_role": ["Law Enforcement"], "subject": ["Defendant"], "subject_role": ["Patient"], "information_type": ["Prescription Records"], "purpose": "Criminal Investigation", "sender_is_subject": "NO", "violated_articles": ["Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution"], "consent_form": ["None"], "followed_articles": []}

Smith, No. 23-60321, 2024 WL 3738050 (5th Cir. Aug. 9, 2024). Amici highlight two reasons why this case warrants rehearing. First, the panel majority’s opinion conflicts with the Supreme Court’s decision in Carpenter v. United States, 585 U.S. 296 (2018). The panel majority held that the government’s geofence request was not a Fourth Amendment search because the location data it revealed covered hours, not days, and because it believed the data had been voluntarily shared by phone users with Google. But the majority disregarded Carpenter’s animating principle—that courts must “assure preservation of that degree of privacy against government that existed when the Fourth Amendment was adopted,” id. at 305 (citation omitted)—and it misinterpreted the Court’s discussion of voluntariness. Second, this case presents novel constitutional questions of exceptional importance, but the panel majority failed to account for the sweeping consequences of its ruling.

{"case_content": "his case involves the constitutionality of a novel investigative technique known as a “reverse search.” In contrast with “targeted searches” in which police have a suspect and seek to learn more about the person, reverse searches involve law enforcement or its agents querying a repository of many people’s private data to look for accounts with certain characteristics they believe will be associated with unknown suspects. The reverse search in this case is a “geofence” that involves searching through a gigantic database of Google users’ location information to look for devices that Google estimates were within certain geographical coordinates during an identified time period. Warrants authorizing these geofence searches allow officers to obtain private location information about an unknown number of mobile device users. Then, outside the presence of a judge, law enforcement officers and Google employees negotiate behind closed doors the breadth and depth of the search. Geofence searches pose significant threats to privacy and the Fourth Amendment because, rather than identifying particular devices for which there is probable cause to search, geofence warrants allow officers to fish for information generated by any and all devices estimated to have been within a geographical area, with the parameters of that search defined outside of judicial supervision. There is widespread agreement that Google’s broad collection of users’ 3 location data is against the public interest. Multiple state attorneys general have sued Google for improprieties associated with the company’s harvesting and exploitation of this data. Eventually, even Google recognized the privacy harms from gathering this data. In December of 2023, after the State used the geofence warrant in this case, Google announced that it would end its collection of the data that enables geofence searches “to give [users] more control over this important, personal data.”2 The public’s concerns with the collection and control of this data support the conclusion that the Google location information police used in this case must be accessed only in strict compliance with the Fourth Amendment and any other privacy laws which apply. These privacy interests are not respected when police search many millions of people’s information, knowing that almost none of them are connected to a crime. Moreover, the police here lacked case-specific facts giving rise to a reasonable belief that whoever committed the crime even generated a location record. Amici agree with Appellant that the warrant here was a general warrant because it lacked probable cause and particularity and improperly delegated the judicial oversight role. Even though Google has announced an end to the data collection that has to date made geofence warrants possible, the rapid expansion of surveillance technology makes it critical that this Court clarify that reverse location searches are not an exception to the general requirements of a warrant. Reverse location searches can also be accomplished with cell site location information and Wi-Fi logs. And police are also using reverse searches to exploit the immense amount of data that Google collects about our Internet searches and website browsing history. These reverse searches seek to identify suspects based on what we search for online and even which articles, videos, or photos we read, watch, and view. The lower court upheld the geofence warrant in this case because it found that the area and time frame were sufficiently narrow. That holding takes a myopic view. As a category, reverse searches are ripe for abuse both because our movements, curiosity, reading, and viewing are central to our autonomy and because the process through which these searches are generally done is flawed. In considering this case and issuing a ruling, this Court should consider its impact on future courts assessing the propriety of all kinds of reverse searches.", "norm_type": "prohibit", "sender": ["Google employees", "Law enforcement officers"], "sender_role": ["Private company", "Law enforcement"], "recipient": ["Public", "Google", "Court"], "recipient_role": ["Private company", "General public", "Judicial authority"], "subject": ["Mobile device users", "Google users"], "subject_role": ["Consumers", "Data subjects"], "information_type": ["Location data", "Search history", "Browsing data"], "purpose": "Investigation, surveillance, law enforcement", "sender_is_subject": "NO", "violated_articles": ["Fourth Amendment"], "consent_form": ["null"], "followed_articles": []}
