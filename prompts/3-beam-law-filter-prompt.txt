Given a list of regulations and an information sending or requesting event, identify and filter out the regulations that are not relevant to the event. The process involves the following steps:

1. **Understand the Event**:
   - Extract key details from the description of the event, such as the type of information being exchanged, the parties involved, and the context or domain (e.g., healthcare, finance, education).

2. **Analyze Each Regulation**:
   - For each regulation, determine its scope and main focus by reading the summary or key sections. Identify the primary subject matter, applicable contexts, or targeted stakeholders.

3. **Relevance Matching**:
   - Compare the key details of the event with the main focus of each regulation. Consider:
     - Does the regulation explicitly address scenarios similar to the event?
     - Is the regulation intended for the context or domain of the event?
     - Are the parties involved in the event the type of entities the regulation aims to govern?

4. **Filtering Decision**:
   - If a regulation's focus aligns well with the eventâ€™s details, it is considered relevant.
   - If there is little to no alignment, such as different contexts, unrelated subjects, or inappropriate scopes, the regulation should be filtered out as irrelevant.
